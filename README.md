Good day Sir, I want to apologize in advance if some of my activities are delayed, the reason why is I don't to pass my activities until I completely understand how to do the task without asking for help of my classmates, but still it is my fault to took me a while to pass. Thank you for consideration (P.S. One of your student isn't good at coding)
